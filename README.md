# 🎯 Pressure-Sensitive Tip Button

A micro-interaction demo recreating Webflow’s “hold to flip coin” tipping button, powered by GSAP Physics2D and Tweakpane. Users press “Leave Tip” and feel responsive, physics-based feedback as the coin flips, tumbles, and lands with configurable bounce, spin, and velocity.
